* Description:
The idea was to get a drum sample at 92 bpm. Once I had that, I looked for a song that had a bass to accompany the drums. When it came to looking for guitars, I couldn't find anything similar. So, I duplicated the bass track, added override, and split it so it played on both the left and right sides. Finally, I added some metal-style vocals to accompany the melody and a distorted slide guitar to fill out the opening seconds of the song.
